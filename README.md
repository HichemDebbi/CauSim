# CauSim
 CauSim is a framework for fine-grained image similarity based on causality. CauSim applies counterfactual reasoning on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify significant filters responding to important regions, then it measures the similarity distance based on the counterfactual information learned with respect to each filter.
